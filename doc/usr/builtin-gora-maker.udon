# gora-maker

make a gora or give it to ships for joining a group

## croaks

- `[%string \`'!gora-maker']` for setup
- `[%join ~]` for giving out gorae

## use

- set up a gora that you'll issue using either:
  - '!gora-maker %make <name> <url>'
  - '!gora-maker %give <gora-id>'
  - wait for people to join the group!

> Note: you should probably perform `:crow &crow-flap [%steal <resource> [%string \`'!gora-maker']]`
  after first configuring this, as it will no longer be needed.
